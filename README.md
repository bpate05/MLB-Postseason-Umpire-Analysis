# Major League Baseball Umpire Accuracy
## Project Description/Outline
We would like to examine the consistency of a Major League Baseball Umpire. Primarily we would like to see if an umpire’s strike zone adjusts over the course of a post-season and whether their strike zone varies depending on whether the batter is left or right-handed. We will accomplish this using an an API from sportsradar which provides the majority of the data. The data we will use will come from 33 post-season game in 2018.
